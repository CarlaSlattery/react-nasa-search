# Technical Test Practice - NASA Search API with React
### By Carla Slattery

This was a project with [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.com) to simulate a typical technical test that you might come across when searching for a junior developer role. The brief was as follows:

## Project Brief

You are expected to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. You are provided the NASA API endpoint for image search.
We want you to consider and add anything to your repository that should be included was this to be a live website.

The following functionalities need to be implemented:
- A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
- Images must be returned upon a successful search

The styling is up to you but will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application.

We estimate this task to take **10 hours**. Once you have completed the task upload the repository to GitHub and send the link to xxxxx@xxx.com. **Deadline: 5 days from receiving.

Relevant API endpoints:

image search:
GET https://images-api.nasa.gov/search Params: q

## Technology Used

This project used [React](https://www.react.org) for the UI and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) was used for testing all components.

I used [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for handling http requests to the api.

## Installation

- Fork this repository
- `git clone` into your chosen location
- `npm start` to run the app in development mode in your browser.
- To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode use `npm test`
